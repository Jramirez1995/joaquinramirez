## SETH HARRIS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EXERCISE

The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. 
You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract
_Write a summary of your project._


{{< pagebreak >}}


# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

To provide a richer dataset, two additional columns were added: "Age," which records the age of each individual in years, and "Occupation," which categorizes their current occupation into one of several categories. 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

#Path to data. Note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths
data_location <- here::here("starter-analysis-exercise","data","processed-data","processeddata.rds")
#load data
mydata <- readRDS(data_location)


#Create a boxplot with the new categorical variable on the x-axis and height on the y-axis
p_boxplot<-ggplot(mydata, aes(x = Occupation, y = Height)) +   geom_boxplot() +   labs(title = "Boxplot of Height by Occupation",        
x = "Occupation",        y = "Height") 
#Display boxplot
print(p_boxplot)

# Save the boxplot to a file 
ggsave("boxplot.png", plot = p_boxplot) 
# Create a scatterplot with weight on the x-axis and the new numerical variable on the y-axis 
p_scatterplot<-ggplot(mydata, aes(x = Weight, y = Age)) +   geom_point() +   labs(title = "Scatterplot of Weight and Age",        
x = "Weight",        y = "Age") 

#Display scatterplot
print(p_scatterplot)
# Save the scatterplot to a file ggsave("scatterplot.png", plot = p_scatterplot)
```






## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.
```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```


```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Another linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```

```{r}
# Fit linear model using Height as outcome, Age and Occupation as predictors
lmfit3 <- lm(Height ~ Age + Occupation, mydata)

# Place results from fit into a data frame with the tidy function
lmtable3 <- broom::tidy(lmfit3)

# Look at fit results
print(lmtable3)

# Save fit results table
table_file3 <- here("starter-analysis-exercise", "results", "tables-files", "resulttable3.rds")
saveRDS(lmtable3, file = table_file3)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._
The boxplot of height by occupation illustrates the distribution of heights among different occupations. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of heights for a given occupation, with the line inside the box indicating the median height. The whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum heights within 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles, and any data points outside this range are considered outliers.

**From the boxplot:**
Doctors have a relatively narrow range of heights, clustered around the median, with no outliers.
Engineers show a wider range of heights and a few outliers.
Students, unemployed individuals, and artists have relatively consistent heights with smaller IQRs and no outliers.
The variation in the range of heights among different occupations can reflect diverse physical characteristics or sampling variations within these groups.

**The scatterplot displays the relationship between weight and age. Key observations include:**
There seems to be a slight downward trend, indicating that higher weights are associated with younger ages in this dataset.
There are a few outliers, such as an individual weighing over 100 kg and others weighing less than 60 kg.
The data points are somewhat dispersed, indicating variability in the relationship between weight and age among the individuals.
This scatterplot helps in visualizing how weight and age are distributed and correlated within the dataset.

**This table summarizes the results of a linear regression model. Here's a brief explanation of the columns and some of the key findings:**

term: This indicates the predictor variables in the model, including the intercept and various categories of occupation.
estimate: These are the estimated coefficients for each term in the model. For example, the intercept is 163.46, which represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all predictors are zero.
std.error: This column provides the standard errors for the estimates, reflecting the variability of the coefficient estimates.
statistic: This is the t-statistic for each coefficient, which is the estimate divided by its standard error.
p.value: The p-value tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero. Smaller p-values (typically less than 0.05) indicate that the coefficient is statistically significant.
Key points:

None of the predictors, including Age and Occupation categories, have p-values less than 0.05, indicating that they are not statistically significant in predicting the dependent variable in this model.
The coefficients for occupation categories show how different occupations compare to the baseline category in their relationship to the dependent variable, but these differences are not statistically significant.

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
